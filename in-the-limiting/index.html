<h1>In the Limit(ing)</h1>
<div class="content">
	<p>This has been a long process, however we&rsquo;re now at something resembling a working limiter.</p>
<h2 id="choices">Choices</h2>
<h2 id="furher-objectives">Furher Objectives</h2>
<p>The main output limiter could be adjusted/developed further in two ways. At present, because of the &lsquo;pink noise&rsquo; assumption of the output, recorded wav files typically leave a few dBs of headroom on the table. This is easily tackled using <code>audacity</code> or similar to either normalise, or boost by ~4dB and applying limiting, which is the approach I usually take. The output &rsquo;loudness&rsquo; eq already mitigates this. We could try to add another final layer of limiting, but that feels like overkill. It&rsquo;s not really a problem in practice, so is going on the backburner for now.<br>
The second thing is that the action of the main output limiter could be cleaned up perhaps, and this would help with raising the level too. It was never designed for that purpose, but to protect from egregious loud noises while playing on a loud soundsystem. One approach could be to institute an explicit hold phase of around 25ms or so to prevent modulation of low frequencies (as these are the loudest peaks, they hit the limiter first). But for true transparent brickwall limiting some kind of look-ahead - this is where the sidechain &lsquo;sees&rsquo; the output before the vca does so is able to smoothly reduce the peak (which takes time) in advance. Due to the laws of physics this requires delaying the signal going through the vca (as opposed to the sidechain looking into the future) so I&rsquo;m going to avoid overcomplicating things for now.
Indeed, a new workflow I&rsquo;m experimenting with is to eschew <code>audacity</code> and use this magical incantation instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>ffmpeg -i &lt;name&gt;.wav -b:a 320k -af alimiter=limit=0.63 &lt;name&gt;.mp3</code></p></blockquote>
<p>followed by id3tool to set the tags like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>id3tool -r SYNT∆èL8 -y 2025 -t &lt;name&gt; &lt;name&gt;.mp3</code></p></blockquote>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really have to be fancy, as these mp3 versions are just for sharing/playing/transferring, but if the limiting sounds fine I might use it for the final &lsquo;mastering&rsquo; step before uploading to bandcamp üòÄ</p>
