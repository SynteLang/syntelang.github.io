<p>There is a London Live Coding Telegram group (email for link to join - I won&rsquo;t post due to risk of spam)
The group was set up by Lizzie Wilson who is an active member of the community - organising events and an awesome performer too :)</p>
<p>Recently there was a bit of friction between various participants relating to Palestine and who is welcome to perform at live coding events in London. As a lead organiser of some of these events, and with a general desire to be part of a happy and healthy community, I of course couldn&rsquo;t avoid putting my oar in ðŸ˜Š</p>
<h2 id="what-happened">what happened</h2>
<p>First off I should say that I&rsquo;m only giving a vague account here so I&rsquo;m not intending to represent amyone&rsquo;s views or opinions. However, for the sake of providing context here&rsquo;s a rough outline:<br>
Someone asked if their friend who was visiting from abroad would be welcome to perform at an AlgoRhythms event. The friend was visiting from Tel-Aviv.<br>
Now, it probably hasn&rsquo;t escaped your attention that the state of Israel</p>
<p>So, after a bit of consultation with various members of the group both online and in-person I think I&rsquo;ve got a feel for a broad consensus relating to my comments on <!-- raw HTML omitted --> :</p>
<ol>
<li>we should welcome artists to perform without prejudice regarding nationality/origin/ethnicity/religion</li>
<li>we should do our best to ensure all participants and attendees abide by the algorave code of conduct</li>
<li>we should be extra careful to be kind and respectful in online spaces and assume good faith</li>
</ol>
<p>If anyone disagrees or has additional comments please say below (bearing in mind point three) or message me directly and in confidence.</p>
<p>I have tasked a member of the community with organising a live code event to show solidarity with the Palestinian cause and raise awareness. They will update us, as and when ready ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>Btw I am not a moderator of this group, nor do I assume any responsibility for the scene in London as a whole. This is my own personal opinion as a lead organiser of some live coding events.</p>
