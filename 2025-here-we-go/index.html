<p>At the very real risk of going into gushing fanboi mode (a regular occurence) - I&rsquo;m really amazed by this performance.<br>
It&rsquo;s a journey, it shows the power of live coding, and it&rsquo;s inspiring as to what can be made. I also feel there is a lot of courage in the performance. It&rsquo;s also in my opinion a beautiful piece of music.<br>

<p>The Jan meetup at The Sekforde was really great. Lovely staff, <a href="https://mas.to/@TodePond">Lu</a> met two people for the first time IRL, <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@boggo">boggo</a> shared a 3D playstation live coding influenced game, <a href="https://neuromatch.social/@laura_porta">Laura P</a> showed some excellent hacking skills in python, lots of great contributions all round in fact. The next one is 18th Feb :)</p>
<h2 id="whats-in-the-pipeline">what&rsquo;s in the pipeline</h2>
<p>Coming up in just a few days we have <a href="https://ra.co/events/2076350">AlgoRhythms</a> - excitiiing!</p>
<p>A little birdie tells me that there might be another Noughty Fingers event coming up, whoop! You didn&rsquo;t hear it from me but you might want to keep the 26th March free ðŸ¤­</p>

<p>There was a fake[dac~] event at Corsica last week, which was great fun. So many people I know were there, Corsica really feels like a family to me. I met <a href="https://nerdculture.de/@nesso">nesso</a> who came over from Berlin to play an absolutely storming set. I was performed as well which was fun, although I still find that my brain really breaks down in front of a crowd like that.<br>
Still managed to do some stuff with intermittently &lsquo;freezing&rsquo; beats which I&rsquo;ll continue to explore. Not the same as gating, although can (and did, oops) result in periods of silence. The technique is to periodically set the bpm to zero using a <code>sq</code>. If this catches a note mid-envelope it will hold at that value until released to continue. I&rsquo;m going to try quantising the effect in time, adding variations etc in future.</p>
<p>Have some more things to post and should have more time in Feb to get them out the door fingers crossed.
Today I contributed to a <a href="https://pastagang.cc/blog/hierarchy">pastagang post</a> - the encouragement has really inspired me to write more, hence this post you are reading. Thanks <a href="https://mas.to/@TodePond">Lu!</a></p>
