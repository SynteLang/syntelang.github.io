<p>What is rubbish, exactly? In the shop earlier the background music was playing the old 90s hit by Wet Wet Wet. Don&rsquo;t bother refreshing your memory - it&rsquo;s a bland pop ballad that spent 14 weeks (iirc) at the top of the charts. Back when charts existed.<br>
People loved that track and bought it in droves. Partly due to being featured in a similarly insipid and also wildly popular movie.<br>
Why did people love something that has so little - if you want to put it this way - artistic merit?<br>
Well, let&rsquo;s start by saying that if they did love the song (and the movie) and you don&rsquo;t, then that is your problem, not theirs. (Also my problem as I have no passion for either.)</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going in here?
Why do people love mundane, safe, dull music?
For the same reason people love living bland, safe, dull lives. It&rsquo;s comforting, more than that, it&rsquo;s a luxury.<br>
There are some downsides, such as increased risk of depression and anxiety.  But especially for the boomer generation whose parents survived having bombs dropped on them (yes England was a war zone not so long ago and we&rsquo;re talking about English Culture here) - the idea of boring comfort has a justifiable appeal.<br>
So, you dear reader who likes to be challenged in your tastes, have an <em>uncommon</em> lust for the different, the edgy, the obscure.<br>
The subtle dissonance of a seventh interval. The sudden punctuation of a 909 kick. The unfamiliarity of a wash of noise interference.
Nothing safe. Nothing guaranteed. Nothing reassured.<br>
Live coding is one example of this.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s that then. What about rubbish humans? Well, that&rsquo;s a story for another time&hellip;<br>
For now we can say that humans are typically rubbish in one of two different ways: <em>in aggregate</em>; and <em>in negligence</em>.  My thesis is that the latter derives from the former, however - as stated - that is a topic for another occasion and quite possibly another blog entirely.</p>
