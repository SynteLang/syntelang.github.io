<h1>Web Rings</h1>
<div class="content">
	<p>Remember webrings? That classic internet phenomenon of the early web1.0 era, which was a great way of finding and connecting to like-minded souls across the internet&hellip;</p>
<p>Well after almost dying off under a deluge of feeds, ads and apps - the good old webring has been making a resurgence over the last few years. And in this, the claimed year of the <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2024/01/03/human-web-renaissance/">web renaissance</a>, they are truly gaining ground again.</p>
<p>This is due is no small part to the tireless efforts and commitment of a bunch of dedicated netizens, who, in various ways cook up a ring system - and a front-end to enable enthusiasts to join. Which is no small task at all&hellip; And then you have to factor in the work in maintaining and curating the list of members - <strong>phew</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="ive-joined-a-web-ring">I&rsquo;ve joined a web ring!</h2>
<p>This site is now the proud member of none other than the <a href="%22https://cs.sjoy.lol%22">CSS JOY</a> webring, which i&rsquo;m celebrating with this post ðŸ¥³<br>
As a fan of CSS crafting I&rsquo;m very much at home is this ring and looking forward to a bit of web-spelunking to explore it :)<br>
Thanks to the wonderful Sara for putting it together!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also applied to join the geekring and fediring, so watch this space&hellip;</p>
<p><em>You can find the webring links at the bottom of the main page (click <a href="/#23-10-18-2-2024">back</a> at the top of this page and scroll down)</em>&quot;</p>
