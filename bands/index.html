	<p>Randomly I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of 60s british beat groups this week - Yardbirds, Zombies, Animals etc<br>
A lot of the groups split up, which made me realise that to make music back then you pretty much needed a band?<br>
I mean there were solo guitarists like Davy Graham. But if you wanted drums, keyboards, backing vocals etc&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re lucky that we can do solo stuff now, like live coding and emom acts.<br>
The possibilities afforded by all manner of hardware and software mean one person can create a whole musical experience from a few bits of equipment.<br>
It also simplifies the process, not having to co-ordinate with others before you can make something.<br>
It&rsquo;s also effectively free to record and distribute music now, as opposed to requiring (an often exploitative) record contract to even get in a studio.</p>
<h2 id="colonialism-and-the-patriarchy">colonialism and the patriarchy</h2>
<p>And lets face it the band scene back then was very white male dominated.<br>
England was a divided country for those who came from the &lsquo;colonies&rsquo;.<br>
I&rsquo;m not sure but it seems if you wanted to perform as a woman your options were limited to being a singer, due to <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@david_chisnall/115281458362786763">patriarchal typecasting</a>.</p>
<h2 id="have-we-lost-something-too">have we lost something too?</h2>
<p>Collaboration is great, but it&rsquo;s hard to organise rehearsals and even just get things started. Maybe we (I) should put more effort in.<br>
I have some possibilities though so watch this space.<br>
As electronic musicians we are often constrained to a rigid tempo, though <a href="https://post.lurk.org/@yaxu/115295163083936944">not necessarily</a>.
Possibly we don&rsquo;t have the same freedom of expression. But tbh the beat groups of the 60s weren&rsquo;t typically indulging in free improvisation.</p>
<p>Then there is pastagang who have used the tech to create a group that no one knows who is in it (spoiler: its everyone)</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">one more thing:</h2>
<p>Its easy to forget that the concept of a band was fairly new back then? Well the idea of a pop group at least. historians please weigh in :)</p>
<h1 id="bonus-content">bonus content</h1>
<h2 id="we-need-to-talk-about-amapiano">we need to talk about: amapiano</h2>
<p>This is probably one of the hugest genres worldwide, yet still somehow feels low profile.<br>
Let&rsquo;s take a minute to appreciate how given decades of aparteid and ongoing ingrained impoverishment, the people of South Africa have chosen to give a massive gift to the world by enlivening and extending house music, which had become pretty stale.<br>
I recommend this mix as an intro:
