<h1>Politics and Algorave</h1>
<div class="content">
	<p>I&rsquo;ve long been frustrated by everyday peoples&rsquo; reluctance to get engaged in politics, like - don&rsquo;t you care?<br>
So it was an odd position to find myself sat on the other side of the fence.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-i-get-there">How did I get there?</h2>
<p>Well, I still care passionately about all manner of political issues, let&rsquo;s get that out of the way to begin with.<br>
I&rsquo;m not exactly someone you could call an activist, although I applaud the efforts of those who make their voices heard in the streets - in the face of state violence and draconian anti-protest laws that <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/united-kingdom">international human rights organisations</a> have flagged as cause for &ldquo;serious concerns&rdquo;.<br>
So yes that makes me something of an armchair activist. I&rsquo;ve attended two fundraising events for humanitarian/anti-genocide causes, as well as providing ongoing support for close friends who are activity engaged in marches and organising. It&rsquo;s not much but it&rsquo;s something.</p>
<h2 id="yes-and">yes, and?</h2>
<p>Ok, I admit that amounts to the kind of virtue signalling one would expect from a dyed-in-the-natural-wool-fibres hipster like me.<br>
I don&rsquo;t bury my head in the sand, I keep up with international comings and goings as best as I can. But I&rsquo;m happy - my project is a different one from direct action - I believe in the power of community, festivity, and creativity.</p>
<h2 id="sounds-vague-and-useless-tbh">sounds vague and useless tbh&hellip;</h2>
<p>Oh really? I beg to differ: I would argue that togetherness, interconnectedness, socialising - are all crucial foundations. But not just that, the day after an event the positive energies will ripple out into the wider populace.<br>
I&rsquo;ve been hearing a lot of advice recently about focusing on the local, which backs this up.</p>
<p>Maybe at some point this year there could be a live code event to raise awareness of civilian victims of mass violence &amp; genocide globally and historically? i.e. including the Rohingya, Herero, Holocaust, Irish and Indian Famines etc
We could produce an info poster for event, which also highlights the nation states who fund and supply the belligerents.
If it&rsquo;s a private event I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a risk of arrest or police violence</p>
<p>standing by in the face of egregious acts</p>

<p>power</p>
<p>what can I do?
be suuportive:
say I love you
remind you&rsquo;re alway here to listen
educate others - takes guts
actions:
protests - we live in faux democracy
be part of connectedness, joy</p>
