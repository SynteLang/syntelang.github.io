<h1>Rifts</h1>
<div class="content">
	<p>It might seem to an outsider that the live coding scene is all lovely and nice all the time. Which is true, nearly all of the time.<br>
But, y&rsquo;know, humans gonna human - sometimes people disagree, get annoyed, or even fall out completely.<br>
I&rsquo;m not going to mention people directly here to protect the innocent, but I&rsquo;ll outline some examples and we&rsquo;ll have a think about what - if anything - can be done.</p>
<h2 id="someone">someone</h2>
<p>someone who was a relatively recent but good friend got very flustered after taking on too much stress (despite my pleas to chill, everything was in hand) then they had a bit of a meltdown 24hrs before the show and me being the huge drama queen got upset about it all. Anyway the show went ahead, there was some cooling off, some boundaries redrawn (this is hard) and we&rsquo;ve been able to stay in touch since and get along well, albeit at more of a distance.<br>
This was a tough situation and it could have easily resulted in a long term rift.</p>
<h2 id="abstraction">abstraction</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re live coders, right? So let&rsquo;s abstract away all details of this example:</p>
<p><code>person x &lt;- person A says they're lovely</code><br>
<code>person y &lt;- person B says they're lovely</code><br>
<code>person A &amp;&amp; person B are both reasonable (and lovely) people</code><br>
<code>person x XOR person y =&gt; they don't talk to each other, despite being valued figures in the scene</code></p>
<p>I have no idea how this situation came about. I haven&rsquo;t asked either (x || y) how it happened. I have no idea how to even begin trying to help heal the rift. Hmm, is it even my place to try and help?</p>
<h2 id="other-examples">other examples</h2>
<p>One horror I live in fear of is someone feeling that they can&rsquo;t come to events, because that <em>other</em> person might/will be there. This does actually happen and I would love to find a way around it (without taking sides).<br>
An extreme approach would be to mediate a conversation where sincere apologies were spoken, but like that&rsquo;s extreme?<br>
Another way would be to have a digital way to co-ordinate when either person won&rsquo;t be there so the other can come?</p>
<h2 id="am-i-overthinking-all-this">am I overthinking all this?</h2>
<p>maybe the scene is big enough so people can slip into events despite rifts having occurred?
I know of one rift which was quite painful and almost resulted in a very sweet person being defacto (and in a CoC violating way) excluded, however although no healing conversation has taken place, with some support they were able to continue bringing amazing energy to events.</p>
<h2 id="i-have-no-answers">I have no answers</h2>
<p>should I have even brought any of this up?</p>
<p>One way to justify poking my nose in where it&rsquo;s possibly/probably not welcome is that rifts can involve or reinforce biases that can impact the diversity of the scene.<br>
But then maybe everything is fine and we actually have a scene that is overwhelming diverse and welcoming already. (I mean, I think so?)</p>
