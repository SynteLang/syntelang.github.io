<h1>Off-Piste</h1>
<div class="content">
	<h2 id="assertion">Assertion:</h2>
<p>Yeah, greed<br>
But people usually don&rsquo;t want MORE<br>
They&rsquo;re usually happy with where they&rsquo;re at.<br>
What people REALLY hate is losing something. Losing ground, losing status, losing money, wealth, etc.</p>
<p>So what happens if someone&rsquo;s amount of something stays the same, but everyone else&rsquo;s increases. LOSE.<br>
This is the concept of inflation.</p>
<p>If the house price of a property owner decreases, or doesn&rsquo;t increase as much as everyone else, then they will be unhappy.</p>
<h2 id="so-far-so-fairly-unremarkable">So far, so fairly unremarkable.</h2>
<p>But there is something else in this:<br>
The ratchet principle.</p>
<h2 id="whats-that-thing-you-just-made-up">What&rsquo;s that thing you just made up?</h2>
<p>The ratchet principle:<br>
Something increasing has a negligible consequence<br>
Something decreasing has a high cost.</p>
<p>What do you think will happen?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what -
After a few decades a housing crisis results.</p>
<p>So, how do we climb down from this?<br>
Well, this effect is already combated by what is known as progressive taxation. The more you earn, the more you pay, increasingly so.<br>
Except there is a problem.<br>
<a href="https://www.pastagang.cc/blog/hierarchy">Power accretes</a><br>
Erm, what?<br>
The thing that progressive tax fights against, fights back. And due to ratcheting and power accretion guess who wins in the long term?</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-do-then-were-screwed-right">What do we do then? We&rsquo;re screwed right?</h2>
<p>Well, yes and no. If we&rsquo;re screwed then we have been for probably over ten thousand years at least.
Because these cycles of power accretion and collapse happen over and over again.</p>
<h2 id="collapse-huh-no-one-said-anything-about-that">Collapse huh, no one said anything about that?</h2>
<p>Ah yes. The reset phase of the cycle. I prefer the term avalanche. Tipping points are reached, the whole stack of cards comes tumbling down.
Sometimes takes centuries. Sometimes less than a decade.
An example is what happened to British elite power (and most visibly property) after World War One. No space to go in detail here, but next time you visit a National Trust property, take a note of the time it fell out of private hands. Also, people have done serious research on this.</p>
<h2 id="yes-but-what-do-we-do-now">Yes, but what do we do now?</h2>
<p>Erm I dunno. Develop an &lsquo;off-ramp&rsquo;?
(A concept from international diplomacy - supply a graceful descent/get-out clause from a terse situation)</p>
<p>The ideas are probably all out there already. Find them and talk about them x</p>
<hr>
<p>One more thing - what does this have to do with politics?<br>
Everything. Politics is about power. Wealth is about power.<br>
It could be argued that all political effects are emergent from the basic principles discussed here.
But let&rsquo;s leave that for another day ðŸ˜Š</p>
