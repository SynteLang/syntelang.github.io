<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="content">
	<p>üåç</p>
<p>This blog is two things in one. The first is to share posts on coding, in particular about <a href="https://github.com/syntelang/syntelang">Synt…ô</a>, a new(ish) live coding platform and language. The second is to be a personal page about me, Daniel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an open source software developer based in London, UK. My main project is <a href="https://github.com/syntelang/syntelang">Synt…ô</a>, which I&rsquo;m also using to perform with on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As a personal site, the purpose - alongside being my frontend to the world [wide web] - is to share thoughts, ideas and generally attempt to explain myself. This does entail that I may unwittingly repeat what  others have said better, but as <a href="">Stigler&rsquo;s law of eponymy</a> evidences - there is barely an original thought under the sun ‚òÄ<br>
Like everyone else on the internet I&rsquo;m an expert in a field of one, but my bigger fault is intermittency so do <a href="mailto:synte@proton.me">give a nudge</a>( if you have something interesting to say :)</p>
<p>There is something else too. It relates to a journey of mine: In pursuit of a zen state of mind and much more free time to get on with my many personal projects, I have pretty much abandoned social media. The only things clinging on are the occasional messaging group and putting my feet up in front of nerdTube, which I should probably do less of too!<br>
Overall though, this change has been a success and has barely put a dent in my social life - a surprising amount of things are still conducted via good old email. What&rsquo;s more, I have been able to really focus and get things done, which has of course been very satisfying.<br>
I&rsquo;ve also been able to focus more cleanly on real-world connexions, again with obvious rewards. I recommend a data-diet to anyone - I started by going down to 250mb per day in 2017 - and have not looked back since. This site will hopefully be a good way to have my own manicured web presence, without any distracting feed algorithms or entrenched data collection.</p>
<p>Namaste üôè</p>
