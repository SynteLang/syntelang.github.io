	<p>Ok, here&rsquo;s quite an extreme take - any notion of ethnical action that can be objectively decided on will always other the subject. Put simply - people will tell you when you&rsquo;re causing harm, usually quite loudly.</p>
<p>Basically ethics has always originated as a way of justifying harm. It would be unnecessary if we could talk to everyone we interact with (roughly thousands per minute)</p>
<p>Okay, so sometimes people have a numb reaction to harm - shock, silence. Often times probably.
Bur still, if you were in genuine dialogue you would notice.</p>
<p>But all this is &lsquo;after the fact&rsquo; - no?
Well, yes. You will still know. Inner dialogue is what&rsquo;s crucial here.</p>
<p>Anyway, do you see what I&rsquo;m trying to get at?</p>

<p>Taking photos is like the card game Poker, you can be really good with little experience because you have no fear/preconceptions, yet it is a long arduous journey to get better than that. If it&rsquo;s even possible. That&rsquo;s the optimistic view at least.</p>
<p>Retaining some innocence/lightness of touch.</p>
<hr>
<p>mild fame</p>
<p>Hearing people&rsquo;s stories of stalkers and coming into contact with those who exploit power is quite scary.<br>
Then I remember I&rsquo;m a failing artist and all is well. The &lsquo;ing&rsquo; is crucial</p>
