<h1>What I Do (And Why)</h1>
<div class="content">
	<p>Ok so it should be no secret by now that I&rsquo;ve taken the lead on organising three algoraves here in London, and also two AlgoRhythms events which are more or less monthly live code open mics, alongside I think six meetups which are also monthly.<br>
None of this would have happened without the support and help of others, so it&rsquo;s definitely not all about me. This post is about how the bits that I did came together and what motivated it in the first place.</p>
<p>The genesis began on this very blog with the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One obvious solution would be to organise an alograve myself, Iâ€™m not great at promoting, but it might come to thatâ€¦&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to say that people were doing events, in fact several sprang up before I&rsquo;d barely announced the algorave. In a short run there was an event at the Camberwell Crypt, a fakedac also at Corsica, and Peckham Digital made a welcome reappearance - they even did another one later in 2024.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-run-an-algorave">how to run an algorave</h2>
<p>This has been my approach, though obviously there are many different ways of going about it. I also had very little experience as a promoter (three small events many years ago) and proceeded mainly by guesswork and trying to make sensible choices.</p>
<ol>
<li>reach out to your peers</li>
</ol>
<p>do they have advice, offers of help, notes from their own experiences, useful contacts?</p>
<p>In my case I was lucky enough to have all of those things. Which really helped get my leg in the door at Corsica who are notorious for ignoring basically everyone ðŸ¤­
If you don&rsquo;t have anyone - find some! There are bound to be some live coders in your vicinity somewhere - go to a meetup - or start one!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>find a venue</li>
</ol>
<p>this was also really straightforward - I just used the same venue that previous algoraves had been held at in London.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>ask some people to perform.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just ask your friends, ask people you don&rsquo;t know too, and ask for recommendations.
I targeted an even gender balance in this too, a rigid but effective way to avoid bias to some extent. Also consider the ages, ethnicity and backgrounds of who performs. I&rsquo;ve never asked anyone how they identify in any category but you can get a feel for things and it will help avoid the audience being a monoculture too. How woke of me. One thing to avoid is booking everyone you can think of, especially if you&rsquo;re intending to pay them all. Ask artists how long they would like to perform for and allow 10-15 minutes of changeover time. This also helps with resolving last minute technical issues.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>make a poster, or ask someone to make one</li>
</ol>
<p>a lot of live coders are also talented artists so one of the acts will be able to do this</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Plan the event. less is more</li>
</ol>
<p>be clear to performers about what the costs are, who will bear them and how much or how little anyone might get paid. Money changes everything (which is unsurprising as it was invented as a means of domination and exploitation) so an event like AlgoRhythms in which no cash changes hands really simplifies things. What I elected to do for the Algoraves which need to cover potentially several hundred in venue fees is just say to everyone that we will split everything equally between us after costs, which seemed fair.<br>
**pairings, sending out lineup, ask tech rider</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>Take any necessary equipment - projectors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the event:
soundchecks
Check in with artists and attendees
Stay calm
people will jump in</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="decisions">decisions</h2>
<p>expediency and democracy</p>
<ul>
<li>a view to sustaining events over the long term
Be as permissive as possible</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="but-why">but why?</h2>
<p>Well, I wanted to go to an algorave. I first asked monz if he was thinking of doing another fakedac - he wasn&rsquo;t (he&rsquo;s since done two more ðŸ¤­)</p>
<p>and why London? Well it&rsquo;s where I live. And why live here? I moved back to be closer to family. Sometimes the grind gets you down, but there are a lot of lovely people here too. Usually from abroad. Occasionally London bites you, gotta stay nimble yo. Sometime I might move further out somewhere, but for now I&rsquo;m exploring possibilities. Doing my best not to get caught up in the traces, while geographically nestled up to the centre of <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=np_ylvc8Zj8">The Spiders Web.</a></p>
<h2 id="as-a-live-coder">as a live coder</h2>
<p>like any method of expression I guess - expect to grow and develop over a number of years as a live coder. (in fact don&rsquo;t ever stop)</p>
<p>To enhance this process I continually test different techniques, challenge myself with from-scratch sessions when I&rsquo;m brave enough, do as many performances as I can, listen to other coders, try different genres, etc etc.
I started making SyntÉ™ in 2022(?) and I still have a <em>lot</em> to explore, which is exciting and great.</p>
<p>there are many opportunities in London, if you want more where you are then reach out, we&rsquo;ll do our best to help.</p>
