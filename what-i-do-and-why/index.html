<h1>What I Do (And Why)</h1>
<div class="content">
	<p>Ok so it should be no secret by now that I&rsquo;ve taken the lead on organising three algoraves here in London, and also two AlgoRhythms events which are more or less monthly live code open mics, alongside I think six meetups which are also monthly.<br>
None of this would have happened without the support and help of others, so it&rsquo;s definitely not all about me. This post is about how the bits that I did came together and what motivated it in the first place.</p>
<p>The genesis began on this very blog with the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One obvious solution would be to organise an alograve myself, Iâ€™m not great at promoting, but it might come to thatâ€¦&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to say that people were doing events, in fact several sprang up before I&rsquo;d barely announced the algorave. In a short run there was an event at the Camberwell Crypt, a fakedac also at Corsica, and Peckham Digital made a welcome reappearance - they even did another one later in the year.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-run-an-algorave">how to run an algorave</h2>
<p>This has been my approach, though obviously there are many different ways of going about it. I also had very little experience as a promoter (three events many years ago) and proceeded mainly by guesswork and trying to make sensible choices.</p>
<ol>
<li>reach out to your peers</li>
</ol>
<p>do they have advice, offers of help, notes from their own experiences, useful contacts?</p>
<p>In my case I was lucky enough to have all of those things. Which really helped get my leg in the door at Corsica who are notorious to ignoring basically everyone ðŸ¤­
If you don&rsquo;t have anyone - find some! There are bound to be some live coders in your vicinity somewhere - go to a meetup - or start one!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>find a venue</li>
</ol>
<p>this was also really straightforward - I just used the same venue that previous algoraves had been held at in London.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>ask some people to perform.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just ask your friends, ask people you don&rsquo;t know too, and ask for recommendations.
I targeted an even gender balance in this,</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>make a poster, or ask someone to make one</li>
</ol>
<p>a lot of live coders are also talented artists so one of the acts will be able to do this</p>
<h2 id="as-a-live-coder">as a live coder</h2>
<p>like any method of expression I guess - expect to grow and develop over a number of years as a live coder. (in fact don&rsquo;t ever stop)</p>
<p>To enhance this process I continually test different techniques, challenge myself with from-scratch sessions when I&rsquo;m brave enough, do as many performances as I can, listen to other coders, try different genres, etc etc.
I started making SyntÉ™ in 2022(?) and I still have a <em>lot</em> to explore, which is exciting and great.</p>
<p>there are many opportunities in London, if you want more where you are then reach out, we&rsquo;ll do our best to help.</p>
