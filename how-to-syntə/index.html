<h1>How to Synt…ô</h1>
<div class="content">
	<p>you may have noticed that Synt…ô has no sequencing - no way of putting in a list of numbers/notes/names to play a series of sounds. This is deliberate.<br>
You may find yourself asking - so how the hell am I supposed to use this to make music?</p>
<p>good question!</p>
<p>Admittedly, it was never designed to make music, certainly not in any conventional sense. Which might seem a bit strange. The concept was more about just, y&rsquo;know, making sounds.<br>
However, it turns out that music is a type of sound so we&rsquo;re all good hehe.</p>
<h2 id="sequencing">sequencing</h2>
<p>Lot&rsquo;s of live coding languages offer this, if not nearly all of them.<br>
but there was something that didn&rsquo;t sit quite right with me about it.</p>
<p>I mean, sure it&rsquo;s a useful and quick way of writing music - you define a series of notes or events and play them in a cycle.<br>
well, I didn&rsquo;t even want to be trapped in a cycle either :)</p>
<h2 id="other-things-synt…ô-doesnt-have">other things Synt…ô doesn&rsquo;t have</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really liked the idea of envelopes, especially the adsr kind. For me, very few sounds are even that kind of shape. I used envelopes when designing/prototyping analog synths - but I found really that there were only a few shapes needed: a slow building/decaying one, an on then off one, and a exponentially decaying one.<br>
notes - do we really need them? Isn&rsquo;t the idea of the western 12 tone equal temperament notes a bit limiting? plus long ago I have discovered pure ratios aka just intonation and liked the idea of that in particular.</p>
<h2 id="ive-listened-to-your-bandcamp-and-i-can-hear-notes---what-gives">i&rsquo;ve listened to your bandcamp and I can hear notes - what gives?</h2>
<p>ok, so let me flesh this out a bit.<br>
there is something arbitrary about sequences - you just put in a list of values and off you go - but aren&rsquo;t we studying patterns here?<br>
part of the motivation for me was/is to study what are melodies and chord progressions etc? Can we find patterns within them?</p>
<p>so basically, to make notes/beats/etc within Synt…ô you need to construct them from a pattern.</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>def 140bpm,4

/b 4,0, trn 4, bdfm 12,320hz, mix
</code></pre><p>the first listing defines a tempo and number of beats per bar.<br>
(this is optional, there are other ways)<br>
the second listing plays an fm bass drum four times (regularly spaced) in one bar.</p>
<p>equivalently we could have written only:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>in 140bpm, osc, trn 4, bdfm 12,320hz, mix
</code></pre><p>so why do the <code>def</code> thing? well this enables other listings to be locked to the same loop.<br>
also, another thing to add: <code>trn 4</code> flips and truncates the <code>osc</code> (which is a ramp wave).<br>
remember we said no envelopes? well we kinda have one there. oh really?
yup. except it is a repeating envelope. so there&rsquo;s no separation between the frequency/rhythm and the shape of the sound. am I making sense?
A diagram would help, I think.
<img src="/wavediagram.png" alt="diagram">
Can you start to see what is going on here?</p>
<p>one of the benefits is that we can filter the shape of the sound!<br>
to make it more rounded:<br>
<code>... osc, trn 4, lpf 5hz, ...</code><br>
to make it sharper:<br>
<code>... osc, trn 4, hpf 1hz, ...</code></p>
<h2 id="yeah-but-thats-not-really-a-beat">yeah but that&rsquo;s not really a beat</h2>
<p>there are loads of techniques I&rsquo;m still exploring to make beats in different ways.<br>
for a simple euclidean rhythm:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>def 140bpm,4

/s 5,0, s/h grid, dec 100ms, bdfm 12,320hz, mix
</code></pre><p>here we make use of <code>grid</code> which has been defined within <code>def</code>.<br>
<code>s/h grid</code> locks the pulses from <code>/s</code> to 16th notes.<br>
because the first argument of <code>/s</code> is <code>5</code> the pulses become unevenly distributed over the grid.<br>
<code>dec 100ms</code> is like an envelope, it converts the pulses to a shape like in the diagram above.</p>
<p>usually what I do is have a separate listing for each drum sound, but you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been experimenting with different versions of <code>def</code> that allow shuffle.</p>
<p>another thing to note is that i&rsquo;m showing these in horizontal form (how they would be displayed with <code>synte -l</code>), while when you type them in or edit would be in vertical form (without commas, each operator operand pair or function on a new line)<br>
the previous example in vertical form:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>/s 5,0
s/h grid
dec 100ms
bdfm 12,320hz
mix
</code></pre><h2 id="taking-it-further">taking it further</h2>
<p>you can modulate the frequency of <code>/s</code> to create variation.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>/b 1,0, gt 0.5, range 4,6, out b
/s b,0, s/h grid, dec 100ms, bdfm 12,320hz, mix
</code></pre><p><code>/b 1,0, gt 0.5</code> creates a shape similar to <code>/s</code> but flipped (you could also use <code>/s 1,0, flip</code>)<br>
the square is low for the first half of <code>/b</code> and high for the second half.<br>
then the square wave is mapped between 4 and 6 and sent to a signal which we have named <code>b</code>.<br>
so b receives a stream if fours and sixes.<br>
then <code>/s</code> uses <code>b</code> and so for the first half of the bar it is a 4/4 beat, and the second half is euclidean(6,16).</p>
<h2 id="this-may-be-confusing">this may be confusing</h2>
<p>tbh it confused me for a long time too. So why bother? well like I said, I wanted to explore ways of creating patterns from numbers - it&rsquo;s really helped me creatively and offers ways to escape predictable loops.<br>
for example, you could try:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>in 3hz, sq, range 4,6, out b
/s b,0, s/h grid, dec 100ms, bdfm 12,320hz, mix
</code></pre><p>where we now have a free running oscillator changing <code>b</code> out of sync with everything else.</p>
<p>i will leave talking about musical pitches and generating melodies for another time :)</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">the bottom line</h2>
<p>If we wanted to make regular music, well we could just &lsquo;use a daw&rsquo;. and for cycle patterns we have the awesome Strudel and TidalCycles (among others).<br>
Synt…ô is here for something different and naturally that takes some getting your head around.<br>
with the unexpected bonus that it really helps creativity in my experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-other-bottom-line">the other bottom line</h2>
<p>I love talking about this stuff, so get in touch if you want to learn or discuss anything!</p>
<p>happy synthesising!</p>
